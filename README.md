# Rails 7 on Docker demo application

This app demonstrates Rails 7 with PostgreSQL, import maps, turbo, stimulus and hotwire, all running in Docker.

**NOTE:** [There is also an example Rails 6 application working in Docker with Webpacker](https://github.com/ryanwi/rails-on-docker)

## Features

* Rails 7
* Ruby 3
* Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration
* PostgreSQL database
* Redis
* GitHub Actions for 
  * tests
  * Rubocop for linting
  * Security checks with [Brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) and [bundler-audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit)
* Dependabot for automated updates

## Initial setup
```
cp .env.example .env
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm web bin/rails db:setup
```

## Testing

## Running the Rails app
```
docker compose up
```

## Running the Rails console
When the app is already running with `docker-compose` up, attach to the container:
```
docker compose exec web bin/rails c
```

When no container running yet, start up a new one:
```
docker compose run --rm web bin/rails c
```

## Running tests
```
